jCompas
=======

jCompas is a Flamenco metronome, written in Java.

Why?
---
Any Flamenco player, dancer or singer knows how hard it is to master _compas_, the basic rhythmical structure of Flamenco styles. jCompas aims at providing a metronome specially designed for those complex structures, while sounding like a real _palmas_ section.

Features
--------
- realistic clapping sounds
- visual representation of the position in the _compas_
- repetition of a pattern or basic improvisation
- easy to add new patterns, via a simple xml file format
